# Precision Agriculture Using Machine Learning

## Description
This project focuses on improving agricultural practices using machine learning techniques. It includes two main features:
1. **Crop Yield Prediction**: Predicts the yield of crops based on historical data and environmental factors.
2. **Crop Recommendation**: Recommends the best crops to grow based on soil and weather conditions.

The project is built using Python and includes a web application for user interaction.

---

## Features
- **Crop Yield Prediction**: Uses machine learning models to predict crop yields.
- **Crop Recommendation**: Recommends crops based on soil nutrients, climate, and other factors.
- **Web Application**: A user-friendly interface to interact with the models.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/surajmoon6/Precision-Agriculture-Using-ML.git

Navigate to the project directory: cd Precision-Agriculture-Using-ML

# Running the Web Application
Start the Flask app:

python app.py
Open your browser and go to http://127.0.0.1:5000/ to interact with the web app.

# Running Jupyter Notebooks
Open the Jupyter notebooks (Crop Yield Prediction.ipynb and crop.ipynb) to explore the machine learning models.

Run the cells to train, test, and evaluate the models.
